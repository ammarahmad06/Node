This file creates a basic web server using Node.js. Here's a simple explanation:

Modules:

http: This module is used to create an HTTP server.
fs: This module allows the server to interact with the file system, like reading or writing files.
Server Creation:

http.createServer(...): This function creates an HTTP server that handles requests (req) and sends responses (res).
Logging Requests:

Every time the server receives a request, it logs the request details (the time and the requested URL) to a file called log.txt. The fs.appendFile method is used, which writes the log asynchronously (it doesn't block the rest of the code from running).
Responding to Requests:

The server checks the requested URL (req.url) and sends back different HTML content based on the path:
"/": Sends "HomePage".
"/About": Sends "AboutPage".
"/Contact": Sends "ContactPage".
Any other path: Sends "Page Not Found".
Starting the Server:

The server listens for incoming requests on port 7000. When the server starts, it logs "Server Started!" to the console.
In summary, this file sets up a simple web server that logs incoming requests and serves different content based on the requested path.
